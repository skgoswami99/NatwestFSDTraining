   Write an algorithm to implement the following steps
        Accept the score of five subjects of students
        Calculate Total score
        Calculate the Percentage
        Then display the grade
            if percentage greater than 85 then Grade A
            if percentage greater than 75 then Grade B
            if percentage greater than 60 then Grade C
            if percentage greater than 50 then Grade D
            if percentage less than 50 then Grade fail

<!-- 

        Step 1: Start
        Step 2: Start the count with 1 to count the number of subjects
        Step 3: check if the counter is less than equal to 5 or not
        Step 4: if counter is less than equal to 5 the follow below steps   
                Accept the score of subject as per counter
                Store the score
                Calculate the score by adding to previous score
                Store the score
                Increase the counter by 1
        Step 5: If counter is more than 5 then stop the process
        Step 6: Display the Total Score
        Step 7: Store the total score
        Step 8: to get percentage, Divide the total score with 5 
        Step 9: Store the result and multiply with 100
        Step 10: Display the percentage
        Step 11: Store the percentage
        Step 12: Calculate the Grade as per below condition
                if percentage greater than 85 then Grade A
                if percentage is between 75 - 84 then Grade B
                if percentage is between 60 - 74 then Grade C
                if percentage is between 50 - 59 then Grade D
                if percentage is between 60 - 74 then Grade 
                if percentage is less than 50 then it's a fail
        Step 13: Show the result
        Step 14: Stop
