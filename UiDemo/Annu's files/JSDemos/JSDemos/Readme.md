    JavScript, It is scripting language which helps to imlement backend logic 

    UI + UIBackend + Backend service


    Any language which you are using follows basic structure

        First use the basic structure 
        Understand how to take input from user
        Understand how to store the input in temperory memory so that

            Different types of Data Types in JavaScript
                String
                Number
                boolean
                object
                NaN
                undefined
                null
                empty

                To declare variable in javascript use following syntax

                var userdefiedvariablename : To declare variable globaly
                let userdefiedvariablename : To declare local variable
                const userdefiedvariablename    : Constant variable


        operations can be performed

            Operators supported by JavaScript

    binary operators

                Arithmetic operators
                    + add the numbers
                    - subtract the numbers
                    * multiply the numbers
                    / divide the numbers 
                    % get the remainder after division of numbers

                Assignment operators
                    = to assign the values
                    += add the numbers
                    -= subtract the numbers
                    *= multiply the numbers
                    /= divide the numbers 
                    %= get the remainder after division of numbers


                Relational operators

                    >
                    <
                    >=
                    <=
                    ==
                    !=
                    ===
                    !==

                logical operators:

                    and  &&
                    or   ||
                    not   !        
                
                unary operators
                    -, ++, --
                
                ternary operator or conditional operator
                    ?:




        perform the operations by using various logics
            like use different operators as per the requirement 
            like use some conditional approach as per the requirement
            like use looping approach as per the logical requirement
        Finally provide the output to the user
